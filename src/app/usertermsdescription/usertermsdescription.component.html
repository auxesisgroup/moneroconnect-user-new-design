      General terms . The following Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern the Main Sale of cryptographic tokens – MoneroConnect Tokens (“XMRC”) – that are required to transact on the MoneroConnect software platform described in MoneroConnect Whitepaper (“MONERO CONNECT Platform”) to Users (“Users” collectively, and “User” individually). The information contained in the MoneroConnect Whitepaper and on MoneroConnect website is of descriptive nature only, are not binding and do not – unless explicitly referred to herein – form part of the Terms or the agreement between the parties. By participating in the Main Sale of XMRC, the User expressly acknowledges and represents that he/she has carefully reviewed the Terms and fully understand the risks, costs, and benefits of purchasing XMRC and agrees to be bound by the Terms. As set forth below, the User further represents and warrants that, to the extent permitted by law, he/she is authorized to purchase XMRC in his/her relevant jurisdiction, is of a legal age to be bound by these Terms, and will not hold MoneroConnect, its parent and affiliates, and the officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, employees and suppliers of MoneroConnect or affiliates, now or in the future and any other member of the MoneroConnect Team liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of, or in any way connected to the Main Sale of XMRC. The user understands and accepts that while the individuals and entities, including MoneroConnect, assigned to this task will make reasonable efforts to develop and complete the MoneroConnect platform and MoneroConnect project, it is possible that such development may fail and User’s XMRC may become useless and/or valueless due to technical, commercial, regulatory or any other reasons. The User is aware of the risk that even if all or parts of the MoneroConnect platform are successfully developed and released in full or in parts, due to a lack of public interest, the MoneroConnect project could be fully or partially abandoned, remain commercially unsuccessful or shut down for lack of interest, regulatory or other reasons. The User therefore understands and accepts that purchasing XMRC carries significant financial, regulatory and/or reputational risks (including the complete loss of value of purchased XMRC, if any, and attributed features of the MoneroConnect project). This document does not constitute a prospectus of any sort, is not a solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any way to an initial public offering or a share/equity offering and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. Only individuals, entities, or companies that have significant experience with and understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, like bitcoin (“BTC”), and blockchain-based software systems should participate in the main sale of XMRC. Users should have functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with cryptographic tokens. While the MoneroConnect team will be available to assist Users of XMRC during and after the token Sale, MoneroConnect will not be responsible for lost ETH, any other Cryptocurrency or XMRC resulting from actions taken by, or committed by Users. No Ownership, Revenue or Governance Rights User understands and accepts that XMRC does not represent or constitute any ownership right or stake, share or security or equivalent rights nor any right to receive future revenues, shares or any other form of participation or governance right in or relating to the MoneroConnect Project and/or XMRC. Ownership of XMRC carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to participate in the MoneroConnect Project if and to the extent the MoneroConnect project has been successfully completed and launched. By receiving XMRC, no form of partnership, joint venture or any similar relationship between the Users and MoneroConnect and/or other individuals or entities involved with the setting up of the MoneroConnect Project is created. Main sale period : The public Main Sale of XMRC will begin on 16 December 2017 at 09:00 GMT. The Main Sale period will run for 45 days and will end on 14Jan 2018 at 08:59:59 GMT or when the total sale orders of XMRC placed reaches the value of 20 million MoneroConnect, whichever condition is met sooner. MoneroConnect reserves the right to change the date when the Main Sale will begin and further reserves the right to extend the sale period for any reason, including the unavailability of the website www.moneroconnect.io or other unforeseen security or procedural issues. Though it does not currently anticipate doing so, MoneroConnect also reserves the right to shorten the Main Sale period for any reason with XMRC value and cap. The price will be set in USD for the Main sale period at 0.1 USD for 1 XMRC. MoneroConnect shall stop accepting new purchase orders of XMRC once total sale orders of XMRC reaches 20 million. However, the actual amount of XMRC sold in the main sale may be different from the aforementioned value due to the fact that transactions may clear or be canceled after the end of the Main Sale. Disclosure of Transactions In the spirit of openness and to enable Users to have as much information as possible to guide their decision making process, MoneroConnect will disclose in real time the total number of XMRC sold in order to enable the User to develop an understanding of the size of the existing XMRC pool at the time of submitting their XMRC purchase order. Sale on MoneroConnect website will maintain an interface, which can be used to purchase XMRC. The interface will be available at www.moneroconnect.io instructions for purchasing XMRC using the interface will be embedded and available for review on the MoneroConnect website during the Main Sale period. Failure to follow these instructions may limit, delay, or prevent a User from purchasing XMRC. Any questions about these instructions should be directed to support@moneroconnect.io. It is the responsibility of each User of XMRC to determine if the User can legally purchase XMRC in the User’s jurisdiction. In XMRC any taxes have to be paid on the purchase of XMRC in the jurisdiction where the User is located, the User shall undertake to pay such taxes. Users purchasing XMRC need to verify their e- mail address and mobile number. Acceptance of the Terms and Representations and Warranties of the User By placing a purchase order of XMRC, the User: Consents and agrees to the Terms; Represents and warrants that the User is legally permitted to purchase XMRC in the User’s jurisdiction; Represents and warrants that the User is of a sufficient age to legally purchase XMRC or has received permission from a legal guardian who has reviewed and agreed to these Terms; Represents and warrants that the User will take sole responsibility for any restrictions and risks associated with the purchase of XMRC as set forth below, Represents and warrants that User is not purchasing XMRC for the purpose of speculative investment; Represents and warrants that the User is purchasing XMRC for the use of the XMRC platform, or to facilitate development, testing, deployment and operation of applications using the MoneroConnect Platform; Represents and warrants that the User has an understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens; Represents and warrants that the User is not a citizen or resident of a country, whose legislation conflicts with the present allocation of XMRC and/or the MoneroConnect project in general. MoneroConnect warrants that it will not acquire XMRC from any third party during the period of the Token Sale of XMRC. MoneroConnect project execution : The User understands and accepts that for the purpose of the development and execution of the MoneroConnect project, MoneroConnect receives the full amount of funds transferred during the Token Sale period. This amount covers expenses, charges and other costs that may arise by MoneroConnect and/or its subcontractors as part of the development and execution of the MoneroConnect Project. It remains at MoneroConnect’s sole discretion to decide how to allocate the funds in order to develop and execute the MoneroConnect Project. MoneroConnect has the right to engage subcontractors to perform the entire or partial development and execution of the MoneroConnect Project. The scope of the development work will be triggered by the amount of funds received during the Token Sale. The User understands and accepts that the User may not have any expectation of influence over governance on the MoneroConnect Project. The User understands and accepts that the MoneroConnect project will need to go through substantial development works as part of which it may become the subject to significant conceptual, technical and commercial changes before release. MoneroConnect Token Platform : the MoneroConnect Token Platform as well as the smart contract has been programmed according to the current state of the art. However, the User understands and accepts that smart contract technology is still in an early development stage and its application is of experimental nature, which carries significant operational, technological, financial, regulatory and reputational risks. Risks the purchase of XMRC carries with it significant risk. Prior to purchasing XMRC, the User should carefully consider the below risks and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professionals prior to determining whether to purchase XMRC. In particular, but not concluding, the User understands the inherent risks listed hereinafter: Risk of software weaknesses: The User understands and accepts that smart contract system concept; the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereumblockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven. Thus there is no warranty that the process of creating and distributing XMRC will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of funds and/or XMRC. Regulatory risk: The User understands and accepts that the blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on or introduce new regulations addressing blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the smart contract system and MoneroConnect Platform. This may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the smart contract system and/or the MoneroConnect Project, including its termination and the loss of XMRC for the User. Risk of abandonment / lack of success: The User understands and accepts that the creation of the XMRC and the development of the MoneroConnect Project may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). The User therefore understands that there is no assurance that, even if the MoneroConnect Project is partially or fully developed and launched, the User will receive any benefits through the XMRC held by him/her. Risk associated with other applications: The User understands and accepts that the MoneroConnect project may give rise to other alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which XMRC will have no intrinsic value. Risk of Losing Access to Tokens Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial Error or your Error: A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of Tokens stored in your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with you digital wallet or vault storing Tokens will result in loss of such Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your Tokens. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store Tokens, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your Tokens. Additionally, your failure to precisely follow the procedures set forth in for buying and receiving tokens, including, for instance, if you provide an incorrect Token Receipt Address. The User understands and accepts that, as with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the smart contract system is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the smart contract system, expected proper execution and sequencing of XMRC transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. Risk of incompatible Wallet service: The User understands and accepts, that the wallet or wallet service provider used for purchasing XMRC, has to be technically compatible with the XMRC. Failure to assure this may have the result that User will not gain access to his/her XMRC. Risks related to Amendments: Amendments to the MoneroConnect Platform’s protocols and software, if accepted and authorized by the MoneroConnect Platform’s community, could adversely affect XMRC. The MoneroConnect Platform governs the peer-to-peer interactions between computers connected to the MoneroConnect platform. To the extent that a significant majority of the Users on the MoneroConnect Platform install software upgrade(s), the MoneroConnect Platform would be subject to new protocols and software that may adversely affect XMRC. If more than a significant majority of the Users on the MoneroConnect platform install such software upgrade(s), the MoneroConnect Platform could “fork.” A failure to properly monitor and upgrade the protocol could damage the MoneroConnect Platform and XMRC. Risks related to intellectual property rights claims: Intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the operation of the MoneroConnect Platform. Third parties may assert intellectual property claims relating to the holding and transfer of digital assets and their source code. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action, any threatened action that reduces confidence in the MoneroConnect Platform’s long-term viability or the ability of end-Users to hold and transfer XMRC may adversely affect the value of XMRC. Additionally, a meritorious intellectual property claim could prevent MoneroConnect and/or other end-Users from accessing the MoneroConnect Platform or holding or transferring their XMRC. No Liability : The User bears the sole responsibility to determine if the purchase, ownership or use of XMRC, the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of XMRC over time (if any), the allocation of XMRC and/or any other action or transaction related to the MoneroConnect Project have tax implications for him/her. In XMRC of any tax obligations, the User shall be under obligation to pay all and any applicable tax. By purchasing, holding or using XMRC the User agrees not to hold any third party (including developers, auditors, contractors or founders of XMRC) liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from the creation, ownership or use of XMRC or any other action or transaction related to the MoneroConnect Project. The User acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable law, the User will not hold any developers, advisors, auditors contractors or founders of MoneroConnect liable for any damages or injury whatsoever caused by or related to the use of or the inability to use XMRC or the MoneroConnect Platform under any cause or action whatsoever of any kind in any jurisdiction, including, without limitation, actions for breach of warranty, breach of contract or tort (including negligence) and that developers, auditors, advisors, contractors or founders of MoneroConnect Project shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including for loss of profits, goodwill or data, in any way whatsoever arising out of the use of, or the inability to use of the MoneroConnect Platform and/or XMRC.The User further specifically acknowledges that developers, advisors, auditors, contractors or founders of the MoneroConnect Project are not liable, and the User agrees not to seek to hold them liable, for the conduct of third parties, including other creators of XMRC, and that the risk of purchasing, holding and using XMRC rests entirely with the User. By purchasing, holding or using XMRC, and to the extent permitted by law, the User agrees not to hold any third party (including developers, auditors, advisors, contractors or founders) liable for any regulatory implications or liability associated with or arising from the purchase, ownership or use of XMRC or any other action or transaction related to the MoneroConnect Project. Privacy Although MoneroConnect requires Users to provide an email address and other information, MoneroConnect will not publish any identifying information related Users without the prior written consent of the User unless required to do so under applicable law. MoneroConnect may request Users from time to time to provide additional information. The User undertakes to provide such information. Users may be contacted via email by MoneroConnect regarding purchase or delivery of XMRC and the use of the MoneroConnect Platform.
