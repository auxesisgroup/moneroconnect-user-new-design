The user understands and accepts that while the individuals and entities, including Moneroconnect, assigned to this task will make reasonable efforts to develop and complete the Moneroconnect platform and Moneroconnect project, it is possible that such development may fail and User’s XMRC may become useless and/or valueless due to technical, commercial, regulatory or any other reasons (see also Chapter 4 regarding Risks). . The User is aware of the risk that even if all or parts of the Moneroconnect platform are successfully developed and released in full or in parts, due to a lack of public interest, the Moneroconnect project could be fully or partially abandoned, remain commercially unsuccessful or shut down for lack of interest, regulatory or other reasons.

Moneroconnect project execution.The User understands and accepts that for the purpose of the development and execution of the Moneroconnect project, Moneroconnect receives the full amount of funds transferred during the Token Sale period. This amount covers expenses, charges and other costs that may arise by Moneroconnect and/or its subcontractors as part of the development and execution of the Moneroconnect Project. It remains at Moneroconnect’s sole discretion to decide how to allocate the funds in order to develop and execute the Moneroconnect Project. Moneroconnect has the right to engage subcontractors to perform the entire or partial development and execution of the Moneroconnect Project. The scope of the development work will be triggered by the amount of funds received during the Token Sale. The User understands and accepts that the User may not have any expectation of influence over governance on the Moneroconnect Project. The User understands and accepts that the Moneroconnect project will need to go through substantial development works as part of which it may become the subject to significant conceptual, technical and commercial changes before release. Moneroconnect Token Platform the Moneroconnect Token Platform as well as the smart contract has been programmed according to the current state of the art. However, the Userunderstands and accepts that smart contract technology is still in an early development stage and its application is of experimental nature, which carries significant operational, technological, financial, regulatory and reputational risks. Risks the purchase of XMRC carries with it significant risk. Prior to purchasing XMRC, the User should carefully consider the below risks and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professionals prior to determining whether to purchase XMRC. In particular, but not concluding, the User understands the inherent risks listed hereinafter:  Risk of software weaknesses: The User understands and accepts that smart contract system concept; the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereumblockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven. Thus there is no warranty that the process of creating and distributing XMRC will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of funds and/or XMRC. . Regulatory risk: The User understands and accepts that the blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on or introduce new regulations addressing blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the smart contract system and Moneroconnect Platform. This may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the smart contract system and/or the Moneroconnect Project, including its termination and the loss of XMRC for the User.Risk of abandonment / lack of success: The User understands and accepts that the creation of the XMRC and the development of the Moneroconnect Project may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). The User therefore understands that there is no assurance that, even if the Moneroconnect Project is partially or fully developed and launched, the User will receive any benefits through the XMRC held by him/her. . Risk associated with other applications: The User understands and accepts that the Moneroconnect Project may give rise to other alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which XMRC will have no intrinsic value. Risk of Losing Access to Tokens Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial Error or your Error: A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of Tokens stored in your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with you digital wallet or vault storing Tokens will result in loss of such Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your Tokens. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store Tokens, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your Tokens. Additionally, your failure to precisely follow the procedures set forth in for buying and receiving tokens, including, for instance, if you provide an incorrect Token Receipt Address. The User understands and accepts that, as with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the smart contract system is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the smart contract system, expected proper execution and sequencing of XMRC transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. Risk of incompatible Wallet service: The User understands and accepts, that the wallet or wallet service provider used for purchasing XMRC, has to be technically compatible with the XMRC. Failure to assure this may have the result that User will not gain access to his/her XMRC. Risks related to Amendments: Amendments to the Moneroconnect Platform’s protocols and software, if accepted and authorized by the Moneroconnect Platform’s community, could adversely affect XMRC. The Moneroconnect Platform governs the peer-to-peer interactions between computers connected to the Moneroconnect platform. To the extent that a significant majority of the Users on the Moneroconnect Platform install software upgrade(s), the Moneroconnect Platform would be subject to new protocols and software that may adversely affect XMRC. If more than a significant majority of the Users on the Moneroconnect platform install such software upgrade(s), the MoneroconnectPlatform could “fork.” A failure to properly monitor and upgrade the protocol could damage the Moneroconnect Platform and XMRC. Risks related to intellectual property rights claims: Intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the operation of the Moneroconnect Platform. Third parties may assert intellectual property claims relating to the holding and transfer of digital assets and their source code. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action, any threatened action that reduces confidence in the Moneroconnect Platform’s long-term viability or the ability of end-Users to hold and transfer XMRC may adversely affect the value of XMRC. Additionally, a meritorious intellectual property claim could prevent Moneroconnect and/or other end-Users from accessing the Moneroconnect Platform or holding or transferring their XMRC. . No Liability. The User bears the sole responsibility to determine if the purchase, ownership or use of XMRC, the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of XMRC over time (if any), the allocation of XMRC and/or any other action or transaction related to the Moneroconnect Project have tax implications for him/her. In XMRC of any tax obligations, the User shall be under obligation to pay all and any applicable tax.
